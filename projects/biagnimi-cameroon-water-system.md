# Biagnimi, Cameroon — Deep Well Water Supply & Distribution System

## Project Overview
**Location:** Biagnimi  
**Country:** Cameroon  
**Years Active:** 2025–2029  
**Project Type:** Deep well water supply and full distribution system  
**Current Phase:** Design phase (travel planned June 2026)

This project serves as the pilot case study for the UTSA EWB open-source engineering documentation effort.
## 1. Community Context & Constraints

### Community Overview
Biagnimi is a small, rural village located in the Centre Region of Cameroon, within the Mbam-et-Kim Department and the Ntui Commune. It is classified as a localité rather than a town, characterized by low population density and limited infrastructure. According to the 2005 national census—the most recent comprehensive dataset available—the population was recorded at approximately 203 inhabitants. While the population has likely increased modestly since then, Biagnimi remains a tight-knit, small community.

Housing in the village typically consists of earth-brick or cement structures, arranged in small clusters or along primary footpaths and transport routes. The community maintains strong social cohesion through traditional leadership structures and local community associations, which often play a central role in maintaining shared infrastructure when external resources are limited.

### Economic and Social Context
The primary livelihood in Biagnimi is agriculture. Residents engage in subsistence farming as well as small-scale cash-crop production, including cocoa, coffee, plantains, cassava, and maize. Daily life and economic activity are closely tied to seasonal patterns and land productivity.

Culturally, the region is influenced by Beti and other Central Cameroonian ethnic groups. French is the primary official language used for administration and education, though local languages are commonly spoken within the community.

### Existing Water Access
At the start of this project, Biagnimi lacked reliable local access to potable water. Residents—particularly women and children—were required to walk multiple miles to reach the nearest well. This water source is seasonal and is known to dry up for approximately half of the year, forcing reliance on alternative, potentially unsafe sources during dry periods.

The long travel distances and inconsistent water availability pose significant health, safety, and social burdens on the community, reinforcing the need for a reliable, year-round water supply system located within the village.

### Environmental and Logistical Constraints
Cameroon experiences a harsh climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons, which directly affects water availability, infrastructure durability, and construction scheduling. Seasonal accessibility and weather conditions must be considered in both design and implementation planning.

The project site is remote, with limited access to major transportation infrastructure. The closest major international airport is Douala International Airport (DLA), located in Douala, Cameroon’s largest city and primary commercial hub. Bafoussam Airport (BFX) also serves the broader region. From these hubs, travel to Biagnimi requires additional overland transportation, increasing logistical complexity and cost.

A key design consideration involves the placement and protection of solar panels required for system operation. Potential risks include wildlife interference, accidental damage, and theft or vandalism. As a result, fencing, secure mounting, and community oversight are being evaluated as part of the system design to ensure long-term functionality and sustainability.
## 2. Problem Statement

The community of Biagnimi lacks reliable, year-round access to safe potable water. Existing water sources are located several miles from the village and are seasonal in nature, with primary wells drying up for significant portions of the year. As a result, residents—particularly women and children—must travel long distances to collect water, often from sources that may be unsafe.

The absence of a dependable local water supply presents ongoing health risks, safety concerns, and social burdens for the community. The objective of this project is to design and implement a sustainable deep well water supply and distribution system that provides consistent, accessible, and potable water to households within Biagnimi.
