- Document real-world design decisions and tradeoffs
- Share lessons learned from implementation in the field
- Serve as a reference for future EWB members and other chapters

## What You'll Find Here
- Detailed project case studies
- Engineering design decisions and constraints
- Lessons learned from field implementation
- Templates for documenting future projects

## How to Use This Repository
- Browse past projects in the `projects/` folder
- Use the templates in `templates/` to document new projects
